Creation of a gRPC server and client

Create a server application, which can calculate simple math tasks. Also, implement a
client which gets input via program arguments and send it to the server. After the server
response, show the result on STDOUT.

### Application requirements
1. The server must support at least addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
2. Dependencies to other packages should be manageable.
3. For the communication between client and server, you must implement gRPC.

- The source code should be easily readable and use the Godoc standard for the
documentation. 
- We care a lot about code quality and unit tests. 
- Please add a Readme file with complete installation instructions. 
- The Readme file should also include the system requirements.

### Personal requirements
1. You must work independent on this task.
2. The amount of work should not be more than 8 hours.
